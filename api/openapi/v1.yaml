  description: |
    Normative OpenAPI v1 for Retaia Core (minor features up to v1.1).

    This API coordinates assets, processing jobs and agents.
    Agents are non-reliable by design.
    Jobs may remain pending indefinitely if no compatible agent is available.
    AI-powered features are planned for v1.1+ and are out of v1 conformance scope.
